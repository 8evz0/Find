# Find
A program for recursive file search by target rools depends from option on a Linux machine using dynamic libraries (plugins)

The program searches for files starting from the specified directory. It is possible to connect third-party plugins, if the plugin meets the specified API.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions - write, it's important!

lab12lvcN32451: ./lab12lvcN32451 [OPTION] directory target [FIND_MOD]
   
	Display information about builtin commands.
	The order of building commands is strictly linear. Follow the instructions.

	Options:
	  -h [--help]	program help output
	  -v [--version]	program version output
	  -S [--string-in-hex]	find all files that contain an array of Latinic characters in hexadecimal representation 
	  -s [--string]		find all files that contain string 
	

	Arguments:
	  directory	The path from which the search begins
	  target	If it is a word, then it is enclosed in single quotes, otherwise in double quotes.

	Exit Status:
	  Returns the full path to the file where the target was found. If files were encountered that cannot be opened (due to lack of privileges), then the full path to the file that could not be opened is given.

Thirt-party plugins: ./lab12lvcN32451 [SHORT OPTION] [ARG] [LONG OPTION] [ARG2] [PATH]

	Options:
	  -P	Path to dir with plugins (default cwd)
	  -A	Combining plug-in options using the "AND" operation (effective by default).
	  -O	Inverting the search condition (after combining the options of the plug-ins with -A or -O).
	  -N		find all files that contain string
	Arguments:
	  ARG	The path with plugins (if use -P)
	  ARG2	Option argument (if required).
	  PATH	Start dir to search (if required).
	Exit Status:
	  Returns the full path to the file where the target was found. If files were encountered that cannot be opened (due to lack of privileges), then the full path to the file that could not be opened is given.Display information about builtin commands when plugin(s) was founded.
	The order of building commands is strictly linear. Follow the instructions.

4. Find all files that contain an array of Latinic characters in hexadecimal representation
   Command: sudo ./lab12lvcN32451 /home "hi" -S

5. Using plugins
   Command: sudo ./lab12lvcN32451 --dl-syms "a" / (to find dl by symbols)
   Command: <pre>sudo ./lab12lvcN32451 --double-bin 3.14 / (to find double)

P.S. To create plug-ins for the program you need to use the following API:

	#ifndef _PLUGIN_API_H
	#define _PLUGIN_API_H
	
	#include <getopt.h>
	
	#define PLUGIN_API_VERSION 1

	    Return value:
